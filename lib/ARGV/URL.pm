=head1 NAME

ARGV::URL - Wrap URLs from @ARGV for fetching and content consumption with <>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

From one-liners:

    perl -MARGV::URL -E "... <> ... "  $file_or_url ...
    perl -MARGV::URL -nE "..." $file_or_uri ...
    perl -MARGV::URL -pE "..." $file_or_url ...

From a script:

    use ARG::URL;
    ...
    while (<>) {
       ...

From a script that takes command-line options that should not be processed by
C<ARGV::URL> :

    # Skipping import
    use ARGV::URL ();
    
    ... extract options from @ARGV ...
    
    # Prepare URLs: do import now
    ARGV::URL->import;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module adds some power to the diamond (<>) operator (see L<perlopentut>):
importing the module will transform URLs in C<@ARGV> so that their content is
fetched and fed to <> like what is done for filenames in the standard
behavior.

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

I<B<Note:> implementation details are specific to this release and may change
in a later release.>

Have a look at the code: this is a 3-lines module.

Fetching URLs is done using the following command:

    lwp-request -m GET "$url"
